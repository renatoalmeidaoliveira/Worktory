Welcome to Worktory's documentation!
====================================

Worktory is a python library created with the single purpose of simplifying the inventory management of network automation scripts.

As the network automation ecosystem grows, several connection plugins and parsers are available, and several times choosing a library or a connection plugin restricts all the devices to the same connection method.

Worktory tries to solve that problem giving the developer total flexibility for choosing the connector plugin and parsers for each device, at the same time that exposes a single interface for every plugin.
